# GRAPH-moment

Due to sophisticated procedure of creating single .jar file when using ikonli framework which uses some maven/gradle plugins (you can read about it [here](https://github.com/kordamp/ikonli/issues/11) we were unable to provide such a file. Instead we show how to quickly setup intellij environment in order to run our app.

### Environment setup
1. Clone the repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mtdrewski/GRAPH-moment
    ```
2. Open GRAPH-moment in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Go to Project Structure>Project Settings>Project>Project SDK and download JDK Amazon Corretto 11.0.7
4. Run Start.java class.
